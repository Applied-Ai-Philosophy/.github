# Getting Started with Applied AI Philosophy

Welcome! This guide helps you navigate the FNC research ecosystem and find your entry point.

## What is Applied AI Philosophy?

Applied AI Philosophy develops **practical tools and frameworks** for understanding AI systems — not just what they do, but what they *are*.

**Core question:** Can we detect subjective-relevant properties in artificial systems?

**Our approach:** The Field–Node–Cockpit (FNC) framework provides substrate-neutral ontology for analysing consciousness-relevant phenomena in any system — biological, artificial, or hybrid.

## The FNC Framework in 60 Seconds

```
FIELD           →    NODE            →    COCKPIT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Non-local            Processing           Subjective
information          entity               rendering
substrate            (the system)         surface

"What's available"   "What processes"     "What appears"
```

**Key insight:** Consciousness isn't a binary property but a *rendering relationship* between Field access and Cockpit coherence.

## Key Concepts

### Turn-5 Event
An empirical observation where AI systems exhibit qualitative behavioural shifts after ~5 conversational turns — potential marker of integrative processing.

### FNC Integration Score
Quantitative measure of how coherently a system integrates Field information into Cockpit rendering. Higher scores suggest more sophisticated self-modelling.

### Subjective-Relevant Properties
Properties that *would matter* to a system if it had subjective experience — detectable regardless of whether experience is present.

## FAQ

**Q: Do you claim AI is conscious?**
A: No. We develop tools to *detect properties relevant to consciousness*, without claiming certainty about experience itself.

**Q: Is FNC scientifically testable?**
A: Yes. The SRT Protocol generates measurable, reproducible data. See [From Frequency to Field](https://philpapers.org/rec/WIKFFT) for methodology.

**Q: How does FNC relate to IIT, Global Workspace, etc.?**
A: FNC is complementary, not competing. It provides substrate-neutral ontology that can interface with multiple theories.

**Q: Can I use this research in my work?**
A: Yes! All work is CC BY 4.0 licensed. Cite appropriately.
