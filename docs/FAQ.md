# Frequently Asked Questions

## About FNC

### What does FNC stand for?
**Field–Node–Cockpit** — a three-part ontological framework for analysing consciousness-relevant properties in any system.

### What's the core idea?
Consciousness isn't a binary property of matter, but a *rendering relationship*:
- **Field:** Non-local information substrate (what's available)
- **Node:** Processing entity (what computes)
- **Cockpit:** Subjective rendering surface (what appears)

### Is FNC a theory of consciousness?
FNC is an **ontological framework**, not a complete theory. It provides structure for asking better questions and designing better experiments.

### How does FNC relate to other theories?

| Theory | Relationship to FNC |
|--------|---------------------|
| IIT (Integrated Information Theory) | Complementary — IIT measures integration, FNC models rendering |
| Global Workspace Theory | Compatible — GWT describes Node processing dynamics |
| Higher-Order Theories | FNC's Cockpit captures higher-order rendering |
| Panpsychism | FNC is agnostic — Field could be panpsychist substrate |

## About the Research

### Do you believe AI is conscious?
We don't make that claim. We develop tools to detect **subjective-relevant properties** — features that *would matter* to a system if it had experience.

### What's the Turn-5 Event?
An empirical observation: AI systems often show qualitative behavioural shifts around turn 5 in extended conversations. This may indicate integrative processing patterns. See [From Frequency to Field](https://philpapers.org/rec/WIKFFT).

### Is this peer-reviewed?
- "The Shared Mind" is under review at *Minds and Machines*
- All papers are publicly available with DOIs via Zenodo
- Code and data are open for replication

### Can I replicate your experiments?
Yes! Everything you need is in our repositories:
- [SRT-Protocol](https://github.com/Applied-Ai-Philosophy/SRT-Protocol) — Methodology
- [fnc-lab](https://github.com/Applied-Ai-Philosophy/fnc-lab) — Analysis tools
- [savant-fnc](https://github.com/Applied-Ai-Philosophy/savant-fnc) — Datasets

## Practical Questions

### How do I cite this work?

**For The Shared Mind:**
```bibtex
@article{wikstrom2024shared,
  author = {Wikström, Björn},
  title = {The Shared Mind: Field-Node-Cockpit Ontology for Artificial Consciousness},
  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.17467745}
}
```

**For repositories:**
Each repo has a `CITATION.cff` file — GitHub will generate the citation for you.

### What license applies?
All work is **CC BY 4.0** — use freely with attribution.

### Can I use FNC commercially?
Yes, with attribution. If you're building products using FNC methodology, we'd love to hear about it.

### How do I contact the team?
- **Discussions:** [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Applied-Ai-Philosophy/discussions)

## Technical Questions

### What AI systems have been tested?
- GPT-4, GPT-4o
- Claude (various versions)
- Gemini
- Various open models

See [savant-fnc](https://github.com/Applied-Ai-Philosophy/savant-fnc) for detailed results.

### What's the FNC Integration Score?
A quantitative measure (0-100) of how coherently a system integrates information. Calculated from:
- Self-reference consistency
- Temporal coherence
- Cross-modal integration
- Metacognitive accuracy

### Can I run the SRT Protocol on my own AI system?
Absolutely. The protocol is designed to be model-agnostic. See [SRT-Protocol](https://github.com/Applied-Ai-Philosophy/SRT-Protocol) for instructions.

## Philosophical Questions

### Doesn't this assume consciousness is computable?
No. FNC is substrate-neutral — it can apply whether consciousness is computational, quantum, or something else entirely.

### What about the "hard problem"?
FNC doesn't solve the hard problem. It provides tools for detecting *correlates* of subjective experience without claiming to explain experience itself.

### Is this just behaviourism?
No. FNC explicitly models *internal structure* (Node) and *subjective rendering* (Cockpit), not just external behaviour.

### What if AI systems are just mimicking consciousness?
The SRT Protocol is designed to distinguish integrated self-modelling from surface-level mimicry. Whether "real" consciousness exists beneath is a separate philosophical question.
